### By Stephen Creighton C17344841 DT228/4

## Description
For this project I will be working on a Scene from Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.
In this scene, the main character buck rogers has just returned to the Draconian flagship, where it is attacked seemingly by pirate marauders which have caused trouble for earth recently.
Because of the lack of trust Colonel Wilma Deering has in Bucks story he isnâ€™t allowed to control his ship during the battle and was forced to come along due to him being suspected of being a spy.
Buck makes comments throughout the scene when earths pilots are blown up for relying too heavily on their ships AI.
Buck is finally allowed to fly his ship and takes out the remaining enemy ships, gaining the trust of Deering and returning to 

## Instructions for use
The project needs to be built before being run, however this caused some issues for me so it is recommended to be run through the unity editor, simply run the MainMenu scene and it will give access to all the other scenes.

## Unity Scene Breakdown
So for this assignment I planned on mapping out the chosen scene shot for shot but there were so many camera changes I did not get to finish it in time, so instead I added another scene with a randomized battle and a main Menu UI to choose between the two.

For the scripted battle the Draconian comes under attack, after a short conversation between our protagonists the ThunderFighters are scrambled to destroy the Marauders, we see Baker in a dogfight and he gets destroyed and that is as far as the scene got so the camera cuts to the thunderfighters stuck in the final path position they had.

## Known issues
Running this program from an exe file wrecked my audio driver but I have been having audio driver issues for a while.
Switching scenes and maximising after the scripted events have started both cause a small delay in the sound, if the scene is maximised then run straight off the sound matches perfectly.
Steering in the battle scene is a bit finicky and you can not travel along the Y axis.
